# CircularSeekBar
Custom circular SeekBar (Circle, Semi-circle, and Ellipse) for Android.

This library is based on [CircularSeekBar of Matt Joseph (devadvance)](https://github.com/devadvance/circularseekbar).

The reason for create a repositive instead of fork it from Matt's, is that the project structure is different.

I make this library run on Android Studio (Gradle), and fix & add more features to the library.

## The features I add

1. Support float progress, instead of integer only.
2. Refactor the name of the attributes, to avoid conflicts.
3. Disable the seek pointer, make it work like a circular progress bar.
4. Some other bug fixes for Matt's CircularSeekBar.
5. Customize the shape of progress end (butt, round, square)
6. Use a arc to represent the pointer, you can custom the arc angle.
7. Negative progress support.
