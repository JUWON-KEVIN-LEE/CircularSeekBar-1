# CircularSeekBar
Custom circular SeekBar (Circle, Semi-circle, and Ellipse) for Android.

This library is based on [CircularSeekBar of Matt Joseph (devadvance)](https://github.com/devadvance/circularseekbar).

The reason for create a repositive instead of fork it from Matt's, is that the project structure is different.

I make this library run on Android Studio (Gradle), and fix & add more features to the library.

## The features I add

1. Support float progress, instead of integer only.
2. Refactor the name of the attributes, to avoid conflicts.
3. Disable the seek pointer, make it work like a circular progress bar.
4. Some other bug fixes for Matt's CircularSeekBar.

## What I'm going to do

Make the seek pointer more flexile. You can custom the length of the seek pointer.
Custom the style of the shape of start, end of the bar & pointer.
